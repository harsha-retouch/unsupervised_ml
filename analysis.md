# Step-by-Step Analysis of `ted.ipynb`

## 1. Importing Libraries
The notebook begins by importing essential libraries for data manipulation (`numpy`, `pandas`), visualization (`matplotlib`, `wordcloud`), natural language processing (`nltk`), and machine learning (`scikit-learn`).

## 2. Data Loading and Exploration
- The TEDx talks dataset is loaded using `pd.read_csv`.
- Initial exploration is performed with `.head()`, `.columns`, `.info()`, and `.describe()` to understand the structure and summary statistics of the data.
- Missing values are checked using `.isnull().sum()`.

## 3. Feature Engineering
- The `posted` column is split to extract `year` and `month` information, which are added as new columns.
- The distribution of talks per year is visualized using a bar plot.

## 4. Data Cleaning
- Irrelevant information is removed, and the `details` column is created by concatenating `title` and `details`.
- The dataframe is reduced to only `main_speaker` and `details`, and rows with missing values are dropped.

## 5. Text Preprocessing
- Stopwords are removed from the `details` column using NLTK's stopwords list.
- Punctuation is removed using Python's `string.punctuation` and the `translate` method.

## 6. Text Visualization
- A word cloud is generated from the cleaned `details` column to visualize the most frequent words in the corpus.

## 7. Feature Extraction
- TF-IDF vectorization is applied to the `details` column to convert text data into numerical features suitable for machine learning.

## 8. Similarity and Recommendation System
- Cosine similarity and Pearson correlation are calculated between talks to measure their similarity.
- A function is defined to recommend talks based on a given content by sorting the dataset according to similarity scores.

## 9. Clustering
- KMeans clustering is performed on the TF-IDF matrix to group talks into clusters based on content similarity.
- Cluster labels are added to the dataframe.

## 10. Cluster-Based Recommendations
- A function is defined to recommend talks within the same cluster as a given talk, using cosine similarity to rank recommendations.

## 11. Dimensionality Reduction and Visualization
- PCA is used to reduce the TF-IDF features to two dimensions for visualization.
- A scatter plot is created to visualize the clusters in the reduced feature space, with colors representing different clusters.

## Summary
The notebook demonstrates a complete unsupervised machine learning workflow for TEDx talks:
- Data loading, cleaning, and preprocessing
- Feature extraction using TF-IDF
- Clustering with KMeans
- Similarity-based and cluster-based recommendation systems
- Visualization of text data and clusters

This approach enables exploration of talk similarities and provides recommendations based on content, leveraging natural language processing and unsupervised learning techniques.
